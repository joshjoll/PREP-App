# Welcome to PREP App!

## PREP-app stands for Project Review Evaluation Project Application!

PREP allows you to post, review, and rate projects that you've created while at General Assembly.

## Why PREP?

PREP allows you to post your school projects, at any point in their development, and have your peers give you feedback!
Having others in your cohort review your progress will not only give you extra eyes on your development, but it will also provide
you with the support and guidance of others that are going through the same course as you.

## Creating a profile

With PREP it's easy to create a secure profile that allows you to post, edit, and review projects!

## Posting projects

Posting projects is as simple as clicking a button! Enter you project's name, the cohort you belong to, a thumbnail to represent
your project, or any other details you care to give. At any point in the development of your project you can edit any of the details
just as easily as you posted them.

## Viewing projects in a gallery

All projects created by users of the app will be displayed in one central gallery! This allows users to easily scroll through
projects and select ones to view or review! Thumbnails and project names make identifying posted projects a breeze. However, if
you don't feel like scrolling through projects, an easy to use search bar at the top of the page allows you to search by project
name, cohort, or user name!

## Give feedback

Giving feedback and "rating" your classmates' projects is the main purpose of PREP! Doing this is as easy as clicking on a
project and filling out a simple form. Simple text fields and a drop-down star rating system makes giving reviews effortless.
